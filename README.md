==========================
PocketSNES for TI Nspire CX
==========================

Port done by gameblabla

PocketSNES was originally a SNES emulator by Nebuleon for GCW0.

He abandoned it after a clash with a dingoonity member.

I then took his emulator and removed the spu & apu code. (since the ti nspire doesn't officially support sound)

It runs actually pretty cool on TI Nspire CX, thanks to autoframeskipping.

Of course, if you overclock your calc, it'll run faster.

Incompatible games are :

Far East of Eden Zero, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Star Ocean

These 3 games uses the SDD1 chip and Snes9x 1.43 requires graphics pack for them to be emulated.
