==========================
PocketSNES for TI Nspire CX
==========================

Port done by gameblabla

PocketSNES was originally a SNES emulator by Nebuleon for GCW0.
He abandoned it after a clash with a dingoonity member.
I then took his emulator, removed the spu & apu code (since the ti nspire doesn't officially support sound)
and (mostly) disabled the default menu.

It runs actually pretty on TI Nspire CX, thanks to autoframeskipping.
Of course, if you overclock your calc, it'll run faster.

All the games compatible with Snes9x 1.43 are with this version as well.
The only exceptions are the games checking for the SPU presence,
if they do this, then they will mostly likely lockup and crash.
No games except test cartridges for now are known to do this.
